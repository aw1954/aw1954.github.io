        <p style="font-size:20px;">I’ve been through many places. I was born in Iowa, before we moved to Texas, before we moved to California. Before we moved around in California from Placentia to Buena Park, Buena Park to Fullerton. I’ve been in many more places in my head. They consist of stories I’ve read and onses I’ve written myself, staring out the backseat window of my dad’s car and seeing something other than telephone poles running past.<br><br></p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;">The only constant I find within myself has been hypocrisy as I shift and alter my appearance, my values, and my mindsets to find one combination that fits like a Cinderella slipper. While others stroll around me, flaunting their very own fairy-godmother-ed heels, I stand there conspicuously barefoot, or with mismatched shoes, or with ones too big for me and too small for me that change by the day.<br><br></p>


        <p style="font-size:20px;">I blaze through places fearlessly because these people and these streets won’t see me again. The anxiety that clings to me, then, is temporary and not suffocating. I can trip, once or twice, and comfort myself with the thought that nobody knows who I am, and nobody will really have the opportunity to find out. There’s peace that comes with that thought.<br><br></p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;">That shiny, sparkly New York was brittle and thin, an illusion that had shattered with the tremendous weight of my hopes. The shards are tainted, black on the edges and reflecting nothing but an afterimage of ghosts and the seeming everpresentness of my disappointment. It seems to be a pattern; my attempts to find home in the places I live in only result in me discovering skeletons in the closet, the tiles, the walls.<br><br></p>

        She never meant to be unreachable; it was he who was always afraid of approaching her. His skin puckered and grew ugly in his extended hesitation, and slowly, gradually, he drew away from her. But that must happen later. Now, he collects pieces of her: quick figure drawings, full portraits, experiments with painting, photographs with his signature blade edits. She is his muse, and she will be for years, until he grows tired of craning his neck up to squint at the sun. <br><br>

        <p style="font-size:24px;">As the dark house shoulders on through the heavy, deserted winter, I’ll continue dipping in my little spills, relishing the sad warmth from them like a pool swimmer unwilling to step into the cold night.</p>

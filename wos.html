            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk">Video</a> One: The Context and Depiction of Art</h3>
            <img src="1.png" width="400">
            <p>The meaning of an artwork shifts with the context that is placed around it. While this may seem obvious, I never truly paid much thought to the different ways in which background music, lighting, a voiceover, and overall mystique can affect the way we see a piece. Zooming in on certain features of a painting during a video may help viewers see its details more clearly, but may also inadvertently create an unintentional narrative by choosing to highlight and omit certain parts of the overall piece. Berger describes paintings themselves as being "still", with the ability to "trap time." I've never thought of artwork in this way before.
            </p>
            <p>Certain art is often surrounded with an air of mystique Berger asserts is directly related to their cash value. This struck me as another statement that we as a society subconsciously know, but never give enough thought to. A quote that left an impression on me was the declaration that cash value is "a substitute for what paintings lost when the camera made them reproducible." It's almost horrifying how deeply engrained and widely accepted capitalism is in our society.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1GI8mNU5Sg">Video</a> Two: Femininity in Art and the Female Nude</h3>
            <img src="4.png" width="400">
            <p>The depiction of women in art, especially of the female nude, reveals a culture of misogyny and the continued stereotype of the submissive woman for the male gaze. Berger defines being nude in the artistic sense as being seen naked by others and recognized as an object that is not ones self. The women in nudes are always aware of being seen; instead of being "naked as they are," they are "naked as you see them." Berger criticizes the tendency of men to paint naked women for the own pleasure while condemning his subject for her vanity by placing a mirror in her hand. He articulates the subtle power dynamics and biases buried in the female nude in very clear and thoughtful ways for his audience to consider. Berger claims that even the female nude becomes another "form of dress," and that women are "condemned to never be naked." I find the difference in meaning between artistic and everyday nakedness very interesting, especially when it comes to the female body.</p>

            <img src="6.png" width="400">
            <p>The female nude is depicted as a "prize of beauty," and is required to be submissive, passive, and available for men. They must show no sexual desire or passion, and they must not give their attention to any competing male figure in the painting other than a cupid, a young boy. None of these points were particularly surprising, but Berger's narration offered a deeper understanding of all the biases enforced upon the female nude.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7wi8jd7aC4">Video</a> Three: Oil Paintings and Wealth</h3>
            <img src="7.png" width="400">
            <img src="8.png" width="400">
            <p>This episode was much more strictly historical, detailing the role of European oil painting as a display of wealth. Moving far away from religious subjects and deep into the secular, European oil painting depicted solid, material objects in almost excruciating detail. The emphasis was placed on ownership, wealth, and abundance. Animals were drawn much like pieces of furniture showcasing the owner's pedigree. To flaunt their privileged education, the wealthy would even go as far as to have their own faces painted in scenes of Greek mythology, which is both amusing and irritating to me.</p>

            <img src="10.png" width="400">
            <p> Berger later draws comparisons between color photography and European oil painting, hinting at the continuance of society's obsession with material objects and ownership.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jTUebm73IY">Video</a> Four: Publicity</h3>
            <img src="13.png" width="400">
            <p>This video jumps into the modern era to discuss the way publicity convinces us to purchase things we don't necessarily need. The concept of "glamor" is utilized all throughout advertisements, promising wealth, popularity, sex, social status, etc. In reference to the previous video, oil painting boasts what has already been obtained while color photography displays what <i>could</i> be obtained. Publicity preys on the public's fear and anxiety, mystifying money and making connections between wealth and sex. It appropriates public figures and the situations of other people to give its audience false promises, distorting reality to the point it becomes almost unrecognizable.

            <img src="15.png" width="400">
            <p>Although Berger didn't touch on it, I wish he would've given us some historical background on how society progressed to this point. I'm curious as to how these advertising methods we now take for granted went into use in the first place, as some of the promises advertisements make seem unrealistic to the point of absurdity. It was incredibly insightful, however, finding out that this culture of greed and vanity was not a product of today's society.</p>
